## Description

In this assignment we created our second portfolio of the course using react as we recently learned. Under my source file I created a components folder where I was able to design the structure of my portfolio. With react the idea is to have a page display without having the page reload. I created a navigation bar that has access to a contact page where I have my LinkedIn, email, and resume. I also have a Projects page with images that you can click on and take you to my projects, and assignments that I have created throughout the course. Lastly in my footer you can have access to my github reponsitory. 





## Github 

On Github I was able to create a new repository where I was able to push all my work to. Before even starting the challenge I had to clone the new repository to my computer first. I cloned it using my gitbash, from there on any code I worked on in visual studio code I was able to save it and push it back to my repository. Once all my work was done I created a README.md did a final push.







## Conclusion

This was a great assignment to show off our new skills building a site with react. I was able to add new projects and assignments that we have completed throughout the 24 week course. As the course is coming to an end this is a great time to show off our new portfolio to companies looking to hire web developers.
